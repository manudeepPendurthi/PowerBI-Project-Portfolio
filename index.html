        <h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>As a part of my Power BI porfolio, I will implement Power BI on different sample data sets in relevant industries to demonstrate competency, expertise in power BI reports, dashboards. All the data, company names used in this portfolio are altered for security and compliance purpose. 
		The skills and technical knowledge applied are as below :</p>

		<ul>
		  <li>Perform ETL using power query.</li>
		  <li>Access Data from cloud, csv, excel, SQL.</li>
		  <li>Data Preparation (update and append table).</li>
		  <li>Transform Data into Data Modeling and explore data by removing duplicates, adding conditionl columns, unpivot-splitting columns, normalize-denormalizing tables.</li>
		  <li>Create custom tables, relationships, star or snow flakes schema Tables.</li>
		  <li>Prepare data Visualization and reporting using Charts(bar, line, column, scatter, pie, donut, ribbon and waterflow ), table, matrix, KPI, slicers, map etc.</li>
		  <li>Perform DAX measure calculation using sum, count, calculate, divide, time intelligence.</li>
		  <li>Create Dynamic Measure, Dynamic Dimension, Tooltip, Bookmark in reporting.</li>
		  <li>Create alert, subscription in dashboard</li>
		  <li>Set up enterprise gateway.</li>
		  <li>Publish, share and collaborate dashboard, workspace, apps.</li>
		</ul>
	<br>


		<!-- Project One -->
  <h2>IoT Temporal Data</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li>The IoT devices installed on the on-field devices are programmed to transmit the timely data of various on-field parameters to the AWS IoT Core. The data aggregated at the AWS IoT core is stored in a PostgreSQL table using AWS Lambda. A connection between the PostgreSQL database and Power BI is established to develop the reports.</li>
		<li>The first page contains the summary of the temporal data visualising the Geo-Location of the asset using a map visual and maximum values of the on-field parameters using gauge visuals. The asset model card will be displaying the manufacturer name and the model of the asset. The asset ID slicer will allow the user to select the desired asset to visualise the data.</li>
	    <li>Upon clicking the temporal data button the user will be navigated to the second page which shows the temporal graph of the on-field parameters. When hovered on any of the data points the user will be presented with the tooltips providing the extra information about the assets. </li>

	  <ul>

		<!-- Project Two -->
  <h2>Job Observation Report</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li>I have developed an algorithm using machine vision techniques to read through the handwritten job observation forms produced by the on-site employees to report the incidents at the jobsite. The algorithm converts the handwritten text into digital format which will be stored in a PostgreSQL database. The aggregated data from the PostgreSQL database is then connected to Power BI to develop the reports.</li>
		<li>The first page contains the summary of the reported incidents and observations. The top of the page has the necessary slicers to filter the incidents using various attributes. The right of the report page has multiple cards showing the sum of the reported incidents based on different filters. The % view button will switch the visuals on the graphs from count view to % view and vice versa.</li>
		<li>Upon clicking the detailed report button the used will be navigated to a tabular representation of the data with which the user can read the actual observations written by the employees.</li>
	  <ul>

		<!-- Project Three -->
  <h2>Project Work Package Report</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li>The information about various work packages in a project is stored in a MySQL database using a proprietary data capturing tool. The aggregated data from the database is connected to Power BI to develop reports.</li>
		<li>The first page visualises the summary of the work packages that are filtered by the activity type.</li>
		<li>The second and third pages visualise the timeline trends and the detailed summary of the work packages respectively.</li>
	  <ul>
